There are a few useful things to know like _how to emphasize text_.

You can also **make it bold** or <i>use html tags</i>.

If you want to provide a link you can

<a href="https://www.palavyr.com">do it like this</a>.

Additionally, you can place an image in `/public/posts` and then reference it like this:

<BlogImage alt="step 1" imgSrc="/posts/example.png" />

Or perhaps you'd like to position your text:

<HPos position="center">
    <BlogLink href="https://www.google.com">Can you believe it? This will take to you to google!</BlogLink>
</HPos>

There is even more you can do in markdown, so let us know if you need a hand doing anything in particular. :D
